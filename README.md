# Prediction model for worker welfare level using clustering and classification method
This Project are made to clustering the welfare of workers based on their work, salary, etc. In this Project are include : 
  1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  2. Data Preprocessing
  3. Model Building
  4. Model Evaluation
  5. Visualization for clustering
  6. Understand the cluster results regarding the distribution of clusters to each feature
  7. Business strategies that are suitable for problem solving

The Classification model are for predict the cluster. In this stages, there are several stages :
---
  1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  2. Data Preprocessing
  3. Model Building
  4. Model Evaluation

And this project are made for fulfill Basic Machine Learning assignment from dicoding
